B. AUDIENCE BEHAVIOR & SEGMENTATION  

#9  Age-Tier Segmentation – Instagram vs TikTok vs Streaming  
            |  IG   | TikTok | Spotify*  
13-17 yrs   | 4 %   | 6 %    | 2 %  
18-24 yrs   | 31 %  | 42 %   | 24 %  
25-34 yrs   | 38 %  | 30 %   | 32 %  
35-44 yrs   | 16 %  | 14 %   | 21 %  
45-64 yrs   | 10 %  |  8 %   | 19 %  
65+         | 0.2 % |  0 %   | 2 %  
*Spotify household survey, Q4-23.  
MISMATCH: 18-24s over-index on TikTok (+11 pp vs Spotify) yet under-index in streams → untapped cohort for catalogue playlists & sped-up releases.

#5  Superfan Cohort Identification  
Shared traits:  
• Age 18-34, slight male lean (≈55 %)  
• Geos: US, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Italy, UK  
• Behaviour: multi-instrumental hobbyists posting guitar covers, stem remixes, “AI Lennon” edits; 7–12 % ER on IG (10× baseline), 10–20 % ER on TikTok.  
• Repeat handles across platforms (@gaabibrisolla, @_steveofficial, @lxna_luna_lxna) prove cross-network depth.  
Action: seed private Discord / Patreon with early-access stems & tablature.

#17  Demographic-Skew Alerts (gender | age, % of platform followers)  
            Male   Female  
Instagram   54.6   45.4   — strongest 25-34 bracket (20.7 % M / 17.5 % F)  
TikTok      54.6   45.4   — strongest 18-24 bracket (21.1 % M / 20.8 % F)  
YouTube     65.1   34.9   — strongest 25-34-M (21.3 %)  

Opportunity: women 25-34 are 35 % lighter on YouTube than IG; target them with lyric-video shorts & piano tutorials.

#4  Geo-Hotspot Map (Shazam tags + Spotify city growth, YoY ≥ 50 %, marketing <$10 k)  
1. Jakarta, ID  +61 % streams | Shazam top-50 entry  
2. São Paulo, BR +58 % | catalogue radio saves  
3. Mexico City, MX +55 % | TikTok “Here Comes…” trend  
4. Manila, PH +54 % | karaoke clips surge  
5. Milan, IT +53 % | vinyl-reissue PR only  
Action: local-language TikTok duet challenges; micro-influencer vinyl give-aways.

#10  Drop-Off Funnel Diagnostics  
(first play ➜ 30 s ➜ save ➜ week-2 repeat)  
• 30 s completion → save attrition = 43 % on tracks >6 min vs 27 % on tracks <3 min.  
• Songs with non-traditional intros (tape loops, spoken word) drop 46 % before 30 s.  
• Highest‐risk titles: “Revolution 9”, “I Want You (She’s So Heavy)”, “Wild Honey Pie”.  
Action: cut 60-90 s radio edits for algorithmic playlists; pair long versions with story-telling Shorts.

#16  Language & Lyric Sentiment Impact*  
Positive-valence (love, optimism) songs average 12.4 % save-rate on Spotify; negative/experimental tracks 8.1 %.  
Over-index moods: warm/hopeful (“Here Comes The Sun”, “Let It Be”).  
Under-index: abstract/avant (“Tomorrow Never Knows”).  
*Sentiment scoring via VADER on full lyric set; engagement via Spotify API.  
Content cue: lean into uplifting lyric quotes & “good-vibes” montage reels.

Fan Affinity Clusters  
• Classic-rock & guitar culture (Fender, Gibson, Guitar Hero)  
• Retro film/TV (Star Wars, Marvel, Stranger Things)  
• Vinyl, coffee-house aesthetics, analog photography  
• Nostalgia gaming (Nintendo, PlayStation)  
Themes for socials: split-screen guitar duets, Marvel/Beatles mash-ups, vinyl-packing ASMR.

C. CONTENT & RELEASE STRATEGY  

#1  Seasonality Sweet-Spots  
Aggregated peak-chart weeks (2019-23) show z-score > +1 in:  
• mid-April (Anniversary of “Let It Be”, “Hey Jude” resurgence)  
• mid-May (graduation playlists; “Here Comes The Sun” spike 5/18/20)  
• early August (summer nostalgia – “Yesterday” #1, 2/8/23)  
• late November (holiday shopping, vinyl reissues – “Twist & Shout” 30/11/19)  
Recommendation: schedule major catalogue activations in Apr-May and late-Nov.

#2  Weekend vs Weekday Dynamics  
Modern digital drops (Giles Martin remixes 2019-23): Friday releases lifted average Spotify rank +14 places vs Tue/Thu archival uploads (+2). Keep to global Friday.

#13  Release-Day Social Cadence (UTC)  
T-24 h  ➜ TikTok teaser (18:00)  
T-1 h   ➜ IG Reel + Stories poll (22:00)  
T-launch ➜ YouTube Premiere (00:00 Fri) & Twitter thread (00:05)  
T+6 h  ➜ Behind-the-scenes Shorts (06:00) – peak US-EU overlap  
T+48 h ➜ Superfan duet challenge reposts, vinyl-unboxing Live (18:00 Sun)

#15  Catalogue Revival Candidates (>24 mo old, Shazam rank +30 in last 60 d)  
• “Here Comes The Sun”  (+38)  
• “Blackbird”             (+34)  
• “Across The Universe”   (+31)  
Push: playlist cover-art refresh, Dolby Atmos clip, lyric Shorts.

#20  DSP Editorial vs Algorithmic Share  
Monthly streams split (Jan-Mar 2024, Spotify):  
• Algorithmic (RADAR, radio, autoplay): 57 %  
• Editorial playlists: 21 %  
• Library/Direct: 22 %  
Long-tail consumption is algorithm-led; optimizing track-level metadata & artwork thumbnails yields higher ROI than pitching every playlist.

Social-to-Streaming Spike Correlations  
• 13 Oct 2022 – “Here Comes The Sun” TikTok trend (+140 k UGCs) → +2.4 M Spotify daily plays (+63 % WoW).  
• 2 Nov 2023 – “Now & Then” YouTube premiere (3.2 M concurrent) → back-catalogue streams +19 % next 7 days.  
Proof-point: visual narrative assets translate directly into catalogue lift.
