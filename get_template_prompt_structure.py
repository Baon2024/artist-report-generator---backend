# ROLE & TASK
You are a **senior music strategist** hired to deliver a **two-page report for bedroom-artist stage artists** for the artist **{chosen_artist}**.

# SOURCE MATERIAL
‚Äì You have one source only: **RAW_DATA** (verbatim answers & metrics pulled from Instagram, TikTok and YouTube).
‚Äì Treat all numbers as trustworthy unless they contradict each other; in that case flag the conflict in ‚ÄúData Gaps‚Äù.

# WORKFLOW  (do not display)
1. **THINK:** Extract every statistic, named entity, quote or behavioural clue from RAW_DATA.  
2. **PLAN:** Map those findings onto the template sections. Identify unsupported cells early.  
3. **WRITE:** Populate the markdown template in polished, presentation-ready prose.  
   ‚Äì Use concise bullet points (max. 15 words each) and tables for scannability.  
   ‚Äì Keep each column width sensible; wrap long text with `<br>` if needed.  
4. **VERIFY:** Double-check that totals, % and age-band ranges add up logically.  
5. **CLEAN:** Do **not** expose this workflow, system prompts or RAW_DATA.

# STYLE
Consultative, insight-rich, brand-strategy tone. Prefer active voice, audience-centric language (‚ÄúFans show‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚ÄúLeverage‚Ä¶‚Äù).  
Use **bold** for key stats, *italics* for emphasis, emojis only where the template already includes them.

# DELIVERABLE
Return **exactly** the filled-in template between the markers    
If a section lacks data, keep the section but write ‚Äú*No platform data available*‚Äù.


**You should use the following template**

How can artist X keep their audience engaged in between album projects.
1) Key highlights
Current audience retention signals (followers vs. monthly listeners, unsub rates).
Engagement hotspots: platforms or geographies with most consistent activity.
3 actionable strategies to maintain momentum in downtime.
2) Audience activity snapshot
Breakdown of daily/weekly engagement patterns on streaming platforms, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.
Geo split of the most ‚Äústicky‚Äù audiences (who keep streaming older catalog).
Demographic slices that over-index on long-tail engagement (where fans continue to interact with old catalogue long after the release time has passed)
Recommendation of where to double down on content even without new releases (so old catalogue)
3) Catalog consumption analysis

Streams of back/old catalog over last 90 days (growth vs. decay curves).
Find ‚Äústicky tracks‚Äù , so older songs that still attract new listeners.
Cross-platform catalog depth (are fans listening past top 3 tracks?).


Recommendation to possibly start a marketing campaigns around the evergreen songs to ensure those fans are repeatedly switched on 
4) Content cadence plan
Content types with proven impact (short-form, behind-the-scenes, remixes, live versions). Will need to look at results from old content. 
Suggested cadence (e.g., 2 TikToks per week, 1 YouTube long-form per month). 
Seasonal/holiday tie-ins to keep relevance so will need to look at current date and cross reference with an notable dates coming up.
Make a recommendation on how to use different content pieces based on previous performance to keep fans engaged. 
5) Collaboration & feature strategy
Identify other emerging artists with overlapping audiences. If the artist is mature this also works for revival and to access new audiences. 
Suggest features, remixes, or joint content between projects.
The idea is to leverage collabs to unlock more audiences when no new album cycle is active.
6) KPIs that could be tracks

Monthly listeners: Are they staying within 70‚Äì80% of album-cycle peak?
Follower growth (Spotify, Instagram, TikTok): Is it still positive each month?
Top countries: Are the top 3 markets holding steady in streams?
Catalog activity: Share of streams from older songs (signals lasting interest).
It is recommended to look out for:
Sharp drop in monthly listeners (e.g., >20% decline in 30 days).
Flatlining follower growth for 2+ months in a row.
New markets not emerging (audience growth stuck in the same countries).
One song dominates too much (>60% of total streams from one track)

KPIs to track:

Catalogue streams trend: total streams of tracks more than 12 months old (should be flat or rising month-on-month during campaign). If you are reviving a track from within 12 months, data might not be.
Individually track monthly listeners to see which top songs respond best to marketing pushes
New vs returning listeners: ratio for catalog tracks (spikes in new listeners means that catalogue is reaching fresh audiences).
Social correlation: follower growth on TikTok/Instagram during catalog campaigns vs what it was prior to the campaign.

Red flags:

No uplift after campaign push: catalog streams stay flat for 2-4 weeks post campaign. This might mean the wrong tactic, content or even wrong track.
Concentration risk: one track accounts for more than 70% of catalog streams means fragile catalog strategy.
Geographical markets where catalogue is being pushed don‚Äôt align with top streaming regions which may present a geo mismatch.

    Fanbase_Analysis_text = """Artist X fanbase analysis: where they are, how to reach them, and how to grow
1) Key highlights
Fanbase size across platforms (Spotify, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)
Primary online hub (platform with largest share of active audience)
A priority actions directly tied to the strongest/weakest data signals.


2) Fanbase snapshot
Cross-platform audience size such as total followers, listeners, subscribers.
Demographics - age, gender, language of the fanbase.
Top geographies - countries and cities with the most listeners.
Growth trend: change in fanbase size over the last 90 days.


Recommendations could look like:
If one age or language group dominates then can tailor creative and messaging for that demographic.
If growth is concentrated in a few countries then can direct content and ad spend specifically to those markets.


3) Where they live online
What is the mix of audience across Spotify, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram as a percentage share 
How deeply fans interact on each platform as an engagement strength out of 10
Weaker platforms: where growth is slower compared to others. This could tell us where to avoid or stop wasting resources.


Recommend based on data. For example, if Spotify listeners are rising but TikTok followers are flat then can repurpose Spotify highlights into TikTok content.
If YouTube subscribers are growing faster than Spotify listeners, can focus on video drops and use them to drive streaming traffic.


4) How to reach and activate
Content drivers: formats that historically triggered spikes in engagement.
Influencers or creators: individuals who have boosted the artist‚Äôs reach in the past.


Recommendation:
If short-form clips correlated with catalog spikes then suggest and commit to a weekly posting schedule similar. 
If a creator collaboration drove noticeable growth then suggest a repeat or scale that partnership with more collabs. 
5. Fanbase growth plan
Geographic opportunities such as emerging countries or cities where engagement is accelerating.
Platform opportunities: underdeveloped channels compared to similar artists.
Collaboration opportunities: artists with overlapping audiences.


If a new country is seeing spikes and breaking into top 10 geographies then launch targeted campaigns in that region.
If there are other artists outperforming on a specific platform then can adapt content formats from those peers.
Audience overlap is strong with another artist, can propose a joint release or content drop. But crossreference to see if they have already done one in the past. 


6) Kpis & watchpoints
KPIs:
Monthly fanbase growth across each platform.
Engagement ratio (saves per stream, likes per view).
Watchpoints:
If monthly growth falls below target, trigger a content or influencer push.
If engagement ratios drop below baseline, test new content formats.
If catalog share declines sharply, refresh older songs with new content hooks.

    Grow_Fanbase_text = """How can artist X engage, activate and grow their existing fanbase over the next Y period of time?
1) Key highlights
Current fanbase size and how it has grown or declined in recent months.
The strongest platform and geography right now.
2-3 clear actions to focus on for the next Y period.
2) Fanbase snapshot
Total audience across streaming platforms and social channels.
Top countries, cities, and demographics.
Fanbase growth trend over the past 90 days.


Recommendation:
If the data shows most of your growth is coming from a particular country or age group, you should focus your content and ad spend there first rather than spreading your efforts too thin.
3) Engagement status
Current activity levels: how often fans listen, save, or engage with content.
Which platforms show the highest engagement per fan.
Recommendation
If Spotify listeners are streaming your songs multiple times but TikTok engagement is weak, should make Spotify the centerpiece of campaigns and use TikTok mainly to repurpose content rather than expecting organic growth there.
4) Activation levers
The types of content that have historically driven spikes (clips, live versions, behind-the-scenes).
Past collaborations or creator pushes that resulted in measurable lifts
Recommendation:
If the data shows that short-form videos consistently trigger jumps in streaming, commit to releasing a steady flow of these each week. Where a specific creator has been linked to past spikes, you should re-engage them or find similar profiles to collaborate with. If email or community channels show high open rates, use them for exclusive content drops to keep your core fans engaged.
5) Growth opportunities
New geographies where engagement is rising.
Platforms where Artist X is underperforming compared to peers.
Audience overlap with other artists.


Recommendation:
If you see that Brazil has entered your top 10 streaming countries for the first time, launch a targeted campaign there with tailored content or ads. If you notice peers growing much faster on TikTok, analyze their formats and test similar ones with your audience. If the overlap data highlights another artist with strong crossover, you should plan a joint remix, feature, or co-branded content drop.
6) Kpis & watchpoints
KPIs:
Net fanbase growth across each platform during the Y period.
Engagement ratios such as saves per stream or likes per view.
Number of new geographies entering the top 5 fanbase list* 


Watchpoints:
If your monthly growth falls below 2%, you should trigger a creator campaign or paid boost. If engagement ratios fall below your baseline, it‚Äôs time to test a different content style. If no new countries or cities appear in your top 5 during the Y period, it suggests your growth is too concentrated and you should revisit your collaboration or geo-targeting strategy.
