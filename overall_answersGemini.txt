### Q8: What are the recent trends or news about Harry Lyon that might affect audience demographics?
✅ Answer: Chartmetric’s database currently shows no notable news, milestones, or press events for Harry Lyon in the past few months, so there is no externally reported story likely to shift his audience profile right now.  

However, his Instagram audience data (latest snapshot) reveals a couple of meaningful trends that could influence future demographics and marketing strategy:  

• Super-concentrated UK following – 89 % of followers and 80 % of “post-likers” are in the United Kingdom, with Sheffield, Greater London, Manchester and Leeds dominating. Unless a new release or tour targets other territories, his audience will continue to skew very British/English.  

• Young, female-heavy core – 18-34-year-olds make up roughly 88 % of his followers, and women outnumber men about 70 : 30. If upcoming collaborations or imagery speak to older or more male listeners, that split could even out, but at present he is clearly resonating with Gen Z/young-millennial women.  

• Lifestyle/brand affinities – Followers over-index on fashion retail (ASOS, Topshop, Urban Outfitters), casual footwear (Dr Martens, Converse, Vans) and trendy beverages (Guinness, Aperol). If Harry Lyon partners with these kinds of brands or features them in content, his existing audience is likely to engage strongly, but the profile may also self-reinforce around fashion-minded, style-oriented consumers.  

• Music-centric interests – “Music” is the top interest by a wide margin (36 % weight for all followers, 41 % for engaged “likers”). This suggests live-show announcements or behind-the-scenes studio content will play well and help retain a music-fan demographic rather than drifting into broader influencer territory.  

In short, there is no single news item driving a demographic shift, but current social data point to:  
1. A highly localised UK fan base.  
2. A predominantly young, female, fashion-savvy audience.  

Any forthcoming press, touring plans outside the UK, or brand collaborations that break those patterns (e.g., U.S. or EU tour legs, male-oriented sponsorships, older-skewing playlist placements) would be the factors most likely to broaden or rebalance his demographic profile.

Because of that limitation, I’m unable to identify or quantify “notable changes … over time.”
