## 1. Overview
Short summary of overall patterns, growth arcs, and platform behaviors.

## 2. Key Segments
### A. Audience Age-Tier Segmentation
- Overlay IG/TikTok age shares with Apple Music vs Spotify listener age splits (last 90 days).
- Compute over/under-index vs the artist’s total by age bracket to find platform-age mismatches.
- Output a table of mismatches and 3–5 recommended actions (content, playlisting, ads) per cohort.

### B. Superfan Cohort Identification
- Score users on recency, frequency, and value (repeat listens, saves, playlist adds, merch/ticket buys, Discord/IG engagement).
- Cluster cohorts; extract common traits and channels.
- Deliver cohort cards (size, behaviors, channels) and a playbook to nurture each cohort.

### C. Geo-Hotspot Map
- Join Shazam country/city tags with Spotify top-city streams; add regional marketing spend and YoY growth.
